Project Description
My app is a two-player card memory game featuring mages. The game objective is to display 16 cards on the screen for 10 seconds. After that, the cards will be turned over. To reveal an image, the player must click on a flipped card image. The goal is to find two matching pairs of the same image. If you click on one hidden image and it appears, you can then click on another hidden image to reveal that image as well. If the two images match, they will remain visible on the screen. Player One and Player Two will each their turn to flip as many hidden images and match as many pairs as they can within a minute or until all 15 pairs are found.
